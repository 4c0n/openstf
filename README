Running openstf (Open Smartphone Test Farm), in order to be able to remotely control Android devices that are
connected over usb, in a browser.

Specifically devices without a (working) screen attached.

Installation:
1. $ git submodule update --init --recursive
2. $ podman-compose build
3. $ podman-compose up -d
   On first start:
    - rethinkdb will create a directory for its data: "data/rethinkdb_data"
    - adb will generate keys: "adb/adbkey" and "adb/adbkey.pub"
4. Open in browser: http://localhost:7100
5. Authenticate with username "administrator" and email "administrator@fakedomain.com"
6. Navigate to the settings and add the contents of "adb/adbkey/pub" as a new key
   This will make the device stop asking if you want to trust the computer with debugging permissions.
7. $ podman-compose down

Usage:
1. Power on phone
2. Once phone is booted, connect phone to usb
3. $ podman-compose up -d
    - stf will install the apk (built using the STFService.apk repository) at this point
4. Open in browser: http://localhost:7100

The devices section in docker-compose.yml lists /dev/bus/usb. However, it is not updated during container
runtime, as that is not supported by the docker "--device" option it translates to. So it is very important
to connect a fully booted device to usb before starting stf.
